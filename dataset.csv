In terms of the first, I'm not a particularly optimistic person, by nature. I don't have any particular illusions that growing up and living life is an inherently and frequently joyful experience. There was, though, a quote I read once, that, paraphrased, said this: that the best one can hope for is that an average, normal child will grow into an average, mildly contented adult. This idea -- that the best outcome of the human condition is ""mildly contented"" -- is something that I not only find myself unable to accept, but which I also find upsetting and distressing. I don't expect my life to be constantly joyful, but I do intend to navigate it not by tolerating it, but by experiencing it, and all the turbulence and emotion that accompanies it. I might be angry, or excited, or nervous, or at ease, but one of my biggest hopes for my life going forward is that, when it comes to an end, I will be able to look back and summarize my life, and that when a hundred words come forward to express a million tiny memories, the words ""mild"" or ""content"" will not be among them. 
As for the second, one of the biggest lessons my family has passed to me is that if you can do something to help a situation in need of it, it is, to an extent, a responsibility to do what you can for it. My parents might not be Spider-Man, despite this dogma, but the cause they and much of the rest of my family has chosen to fight for has been conservation. I grew up surrounded by the tangible progress my parents and grandparents made in California and beyond preserving nature for generations to come and slowing down the long-term damage which has been so prevalent recently in climate reports and press releases. I have always been deeply inspired by what they do and how they chose to spend their lives, and though I don't know yet in what arena I would like to practice it, I intend to follow in their footsteps and use my life to make a difference, in whatever way I can.
Finally, aside from these large and somewhat vague ambitions, I have a thousand smaller hopes and dreams. Some of these are: having a home in the woods, and adopting a pack of dogs to keep me company there; writing and publishing a fiction novel; try a dragonfruit; learn to sailboard; and maybe even, after all these years, learn how to make a functional gluten free pie crust, to serve my mom at Thanksgiving.","The most helpful way L&C may be able to support me this has to do with the migraines I get frequently. I hope to establish a 504 plan with the office of student accessibility, so that I might be able to receive certain accommodations for moments when my physical health compromises my ability to attend class or complete work as quickly as I might otherwise be able to."

Being able to acknowledge that no one really knows what lies ahead and still being willing to be a support system through anything is important and making sure students know that is even more important. School is already stressful but when you add heightened emotional stress and trying to get back to being in a more traditional setting there are definitely going to be setbacks.

The first option is something that follows things I have enjoyed in the past (I’ve always liked reading and been a naturally pretty strong writer as well as an analytic thinker), and I think would work well with my intended philosophy major, but also with a different major in the humanities if I decide to switch to something else. The second option is something I’m not as sure whether I’d enjoy or not, because I don’t have much experience in the field, so it’s something I want to explore during college, maybe with internships but also just seeing how doing a math major goes. One thing is that I want to make a lot of money, and I know academia probably wouldn’t provide that, so I will definitely be making a life plan with that in mind, but at the same time I also want to be doing what I really love. Something that I have also always thought would be a dream job is something in music, for example a sound/score producer for movie soundtracks, but I’m just not sure I actually have the experience or skills to go into that professionally. However I guess I will talk to the career center at college and see if there are ways for me to explore that kind of career field--after all, I will probably end up having a minor in music or if not that I at least want to take a lot of classes. Interesting and horizon-broadening experiences, especially travel aka seeing different parts of the world is something really important to me that I want to follow in my adult life. That’s one of the reasons that making money is so important to me, but I also think if I could find internships and/or a job that allows me to work in various parts of the world for stretches of time, that would be ideal. I find languages fascinating and want to be a polyglot to engage in the cultures of many places regardless of what job I end up with. Finally, though building an interesting and fulfilling career is important to me, putting that aside, friends and having communities of people I spend time with is also vital to me in my life. I don’t see myself settling down with a partner and children or anything like that. Of course I want companionship in the future, but I see myself living in a city or multiple cities, having adventures with a group of friends. I know a lot of people tend to stop having as many friends or hobbies, or they just get busy and stop spending as much time with them as they get older, so it’s something I want to prioritize as I become an adult--making connections with people who are similar to me with similar interests and goals in life, and having not just one partner but a network of friends. I see myself without children continuing to partake in the things I enjoy like music, art, sports, reading and writing, or whatever else I am interested in, but the main thing is to continue having hobbies and varied interests and to find people I can engage with.","I want to build relationships with staff at L&C that will help me make connections and find academic opportunities in the future. I want to participate in professor research while at college. I am also planning to take advantage of the career center to find internships or other opportunities relevant to my interests.
